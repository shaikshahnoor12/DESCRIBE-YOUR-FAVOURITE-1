        <p id="hyd">I like Hyderabad because it has more monuments upto 19 monuments.Even Hyderabad is famous for its food,culture, its language and etc.Its historic sites include Golconda Fort, a former diamond-trading center that was once the Qutb Shahi dynastic capital. The Charminar, a 16th-century mosque whose 4 arches support towering minarets, is an old city landmark near the long-standing Laad Bazaar.</p>
